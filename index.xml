Kind of a like a Raspberry Pi with webcam, but much powerful and easier to setup(that&amp;rsquo;s if you are familiar with AWS).
Face recognition, is a complex problem that takes several steps as mentioned in my previous post on &amp;ldquo;Using AWS Rekognition For Face Recognition&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Using AWS Rekognition For Facial Recognition</title><link>https://jasperabez.github.io/blog/using-aws-rekognition-for-face-recognition/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jasperabez.github.io/blog/using-aws-rekognition-for-face-recognition/</guid><description>Facial recognition is kind of neat, and had been quite widely use as a quick and dirty way of identifying an individual.
Traditionally to implement Facial recognition we need to:
Identify Faces in an Image
Extract features from the face
Store the features from step 2 in a database, tagged with a name/index
Repeat Step 1 and 2, and compare the new features with all the faces in the database using a classifier then you will get the desired name/index</description></item><item><title>SPOT - SIP</title><link>https://jasperabez.github.io/blog/spot-sip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jasperabez.github.io/blog/spot-sip/</guid><description>In our second year of study in Singapore Polytechnic (SP), we are required to take a module called Social Innovation Project (SIP).
SIP is a module to teach us the design thinking process. We focus on a particular group in the society and develop an appropriate solution/product to help them using the design thinking process. We had to conduct interviews, create a persona from the data we collected, make a prototype based on the persona, showcase our prototype in a gallery walk, and finally refine our prototype for our final presentation based on the feedback we received.</description></item><item><title>PMDiquette</title><link>https://jasperabez.github.io/projects/pmdiquette/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jasperabez.github.io/projects/pmdiquette/</guid><description>PMDiquette is a virtual reality-based personal mobility device (PMD) safety training simulator which we developed for AWS BuildOn 2019.
