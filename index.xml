Kind of a like a Raspberry Pi with webcam, but much powerful and easier to setup(that&amp;rsquo;s if you are familiar with AWS).
Face recognition, is a complex problem that takes several steps as mentioned in my previous post on &amp;ldquo;Using AWS Rekognition For Face Recognition&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Using AWS Rekognition For Facial Recognition</title><link>/blog/using-aws-rekognition-for-face-recognition/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/using-aws-rekognition-for-face-recognition/</guid><description>Facial recognition is kind of neat, and had been quite widely use as a quick and dirty way of identifying an individual.
Traditionally to implement Facial recognition we need to:
Identify Faces in an Image
Extract features from the face
Store the features from step 2 in a database, tagged with a name/index
Repeat Step 1 and 2, and compare the new features with all the faces in the database using a classifier then you will get the desired name/index</description></item><item><title>SPOT - SIP</title><link>/blog/spot-sip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/spot-sip/</guid><description>In our second year of study in Singapore Polytechnic (SP), we are required to take a module called Social Innovation Project (SIP).
SIP is a module to teach us the design thinking process. We focus on a particular group in the society and develop an appropriate solution/product to help them using the design thinking process. We had to conduct interviews, create a persona from the data we collected, make a prototype based on the persona, showcase our prototype in a gallery walk, and finally refine our prototype for our final presentation based on the feedback we received.</description></item><item><title>AWS budget alert setup (email and sms)</title><link>/blog/aws-budget-alert-setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/aws-budget-alert-setup/</guid><description>As a newbie to AWS who is pretty broke, it is kind of important not to overspend due to own negligence or ignorance in the services that AWS employs, for example not shutting down instances, leak keys etc. Having a budget alert would quickly notify you in real time when you start spending real money in AWS that is more than you are willing to.

Download and install in VS Code
To start developing: npm run start
To generate the site HTML: npm run build
npm run start will run two command parallel: npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/style.css &amp;ndash;watch
and hugo server
Note: When you start npm run start a style.css must exist - or you get an error! Just do a Ctrl+C and run npm run start - even though you got an error but a style was written anyway and 2nd time round it should start fine.</description></item></channel></rss>
