TweetRescue is a project that was created for the SCDF X IBM Innovation Challenge 2020. Its primary objective is to offer an effortless and user-friendly approach for citizens to report potential or existing fire and obstruction hazards through Twitter by using a designated hashtag (#scdftweetrescue). By using image analysis technology, the system can quickly identify and filter out irrelevant alerts to ensure that only genuine reports are forwarded to relevant authorities. Thus, enabling authorities to act promptly and efficiently to mitigate potential dangers.
