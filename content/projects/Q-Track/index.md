Q-Track is an all encompassing attedance taking system, enabled via the usage of personalized QR code. Made for my church, it was kept simple utilizing on free, easy to use online services such as Netlify and Google Apps Script for Google Sheets integration. The system works across the web and on android, sharing one unified codebase and paired with a supplementary React app to enable quick distribution of the personalized QR codes.
