The system provides customized food item allocation based on beneficiaries' unique preferences and needs, and matches suitable volunteers to distribute them optimally, reducing food wastage and promoting sustainability. The system leverages on AWS serverless resources (Lambda, Amplify, DynamoDB) for scalability and integration of IoT resources (IoT Core).
