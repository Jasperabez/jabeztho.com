Hi, I am Jabez your friendly neighborhood tech enthunsiast.
I developed the passion for technology when I was
homeschooled in the earlier parts of my life, spending my time configuring
Linux systems and picking up programming.

Driven by my passion, I majored in computer engineeering and actively participated (and won!) multiple hackathons, making
some great friends and mentors during my journey. Hackathons also allowed
me to apply my technical skills in helping the community meaningfully.

I started out this blog to document my adventures in exploring different
technologies, covering topics on embedded, operating systems, software, cloud, and
even some of my experiences in real life.
